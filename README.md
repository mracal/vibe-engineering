**38 engineering discipline skills for Claude Code + a CLI for CI/CD enforcement.** Extracted from real-world multi-agent system development — not theoretical best practices, but patterns that survived 3 weeks of intensive production development with 205+ test files, 11 agents, and 50+ session observations.

> "Vibe coding" meets engineering rigor. Every skill here exists because skipping it caused real pain.

### One command. Instant engineering discipline.

```bash
claude plugin add github:ash1794/vibe-engineering
```

Claude automatically discovers and applies the right skill for every task — research before design, quality gates before shipping, structured debugging before guessing, test coverage before claiming "done."

## What is this?

A Claude Code plugin with 38 skills that enforce engineering discipline across any project, plus a lightweight CLI (`vibe-cli`) for CI/CD pipelines and automation:

- **Research & Decision-Making** (5 skills) — Think before building
- **Quality Gates & Validation** (7 skills) — Catch issues before they ship
- **Learning & Knowledge Management** (5 skills) — Never solve the same problem twice
- **Parallel & Multi-Agent Development** (4 skills) — Scale your work safely
- **Testing Patterns** (5 skills) — Test what matters, not just what's easy
- **Deployment & Operations** (4 skills) — Ship with confidence
- **Gap Analysis & Remediation** (2 skills) — Audit and systematically close gaps
- **Communication & Process** (4 skills) — Stay focused, stay clear
- **Meta Skills** (2 skills) — Skill discovery and routing

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (recommended)

```bash
claude plugin add github:ash1794/vibe-engineering
```

That's it. All 38 skills are now available in every Claude Code session.

### Option 2: Development / local testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ash1794/vibe-engineering.git
claude --plugin-dir ./vibe-engineering
```

## Quick Start

After installation, Claude automatically discovers vibe-engineering skills. The bootstrap skill teaches Claude to check for applicable skills before every action.

Explore available skills interactively:
```
/vibe-engineering:vibe-help
```

Invoke any skill directly:
```
/vibe-engineering:vibe-quality-loop
/vibe-engineering:vibe-research-before-design
/vibe-engineering:vibe-reflect-and-compound
```

## CLI: `vibe-cli`

The `vibe-cli` CLI wraps critical skills into CI/CD-friendly commands with proper exit codes and JSON output. No dependencies — pure bash.

### Setup

```bash
# Make it available system-wide (optional)
ln -s $(pwd)/scripts/vibe-cli /usr/local/bin/vibe-cli

# Or run directly from the repo
./scripts/vibe-cli help
```

### Commands

```bash
vibe-cli pre-commit          # Scan staged changes for secrets, debug code, disabled tests
vibe-cli coverage            # Run test coverage and report against tier targets
vibe-cli spec-drift          # Detect spec-code drift from staged changes
vibe-cli decisions           # Extract decisions from staged diff
vibe-cli validate            # Validate skill files and manifests
vibe-cli hook install        # Install as git pre-commit hook
vibe-cli hook uninstall      # Remove git pre-commit hook
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All checks passed |
| `1` | Blocking issues (CI should fail) |
| `2` | Warnings only (non-blocking) |

### JSON Output

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
vibe-cli pre-commit --json
# {"status":"fail","blockers":1,"warnings":3,"findings":[...]}

vibe-cli coverage --json --spec docs/spec.md
# {"status":"pass","tool":"pytest","line_coverage":85,"spec_to_test":{"total":12,"covered":8}}

vibe-cli spec-drift --json --spec docs/spec.md
# {"status":"drift_detected","drift_items":3,"spec":"docs/spec.md","items":[...]}

vibe-cli decisions --json
# {"status":"decisions_found","count":4,"files_changed":7,"decisions":[...]}
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Vibe pre-commit check
  run: ./scripts/vibe-cli pre-commit --json

- name: Coverage check
  run: ./scripts/vibe-cli coverage --spec docs/spec.md
```

**GitLab CI:**
```yaml
vibe-checks:
  script:
    - ./scripts/vibe-cli pre-commit
    - ./scripts/vibe-cli coverage --spec docs/spec.md
```

**Pre-commit hook (automatic):**
```bash
# Install once — blocks commits with secrets, debug code, etc.
./scripts/vibe-cli hook install
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `VIBE_OUTPUT=json` | Same as `--json` |
| `VIBE_SPEC=<path>` | Default spec path for spec-drift/coverage |
| `VIBE_TEST_DIR=<path>` | Default test directory |
| `NO_COLOR=1` | Disable colored output |

## The Spec-Code-Test Loop

Four skills form a connected workflow that keeps spec, tests, and code in sync:

```
Code changes
    ↓
vibe-decision-journal ──→ Extract decisions from diffs
    ↓
vibe-spec-sync ──→ Update spec to reflect approved decisions
    ↓
vibe-adversarial-test-generation ──→ Generate spec-driven tests with req:ID traceability
    ↓
vibe-coverage-enforcer ──→ Verify 3 dimensions (line + spec-to-test + spec-to-code)
    ↓
vibe-spec-vs-code-audit ──→ Final verification: no remaining gaps
```

The CLI exposes the critical parts for automation:
- `vibe decisions` → extract decisions from staged changes
- `vibe spec-drift` → detect spec-code drift
- `vibe coverage` → verify all coverage dimensions
- `vibe pre-commit` → block commits with secrets/debug code

## Why vibe-engineering?

Without discipline skills, AI coding assistants make the same mistakes humans do — skip research, ship without tests, rationalize shortcuts, lose context across sessions. **vibe-engineering catches these patterns automatically.**

| Without | With vibe-engineering |
|---------|----------------------|
| "Let me just build it" | Research existing solutions first (`vibe-research-before-design`) |
| "Tests pass, ship it" | Check coverage standards are met (`vibe-coverage-enforcer`) |
| "I'll remember the decision" | Extract it automatically from diffs (`vibe-decision-journal`) |
| "Good enough" | Loop until clean (`vibe-quality-loop`) |
| "Spec is probably still accurate" | Detect drift and sync back (`vibe-spec-sync`) |
| "This is simple, no need for..." | Catch rationalization in real-time (`vibe-anti-rationalization-check`) |
| Debug by guessing | Systematic root cause analysis (`vibe-debugging-journal`) |
| Context lost between sessions | Auto-generated handover docs (`vibe-handover-doc`) |

## Design Principles

1. **Born from pain, not theory** — Every skill exists because skipping it caused real problems
2. **When to use AND when NOT to use** — Every skill has explicit triggers and anti-triggers
3. **Composable** — Skills work independently or together
4. **Advisory first, enforcement when it matters** — Skills guide; CLI enforces in CI/CD
5. **Cross-project** — No project-specific assumptions. Works with any language/framework

## How It Works

This is a standard Claude Code plugin. The `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest registers it, and the `skills/` directory contains 38 skill definitions that Claude auto-discovers based on task context.

```
vibe-engineering/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest
├── skills/                  # 38 skill definitions
│   ├── vibe-help/SKILL.md
│   ├── quality-loop/SKILL.md
│   ├── spec-sync/SKILL.md
│   ├── decision-journal/SKILL.md
│   ├── gap-analysis/SKILL.md

├── scripts/
│   ├── vibe-cli           # CLI for CI/CD enforcement
│   └── validate-skills.sh # Skill file validator
└── README.md
```

Each skill has:
- **YAML frontmatter** with name, description, and invocation config
- **When to Use** — explicit triggers
- **When NOT to Use** — anti-triggers to prevent misapplication
- **Steps** — the actual workflow
- **Output Format** — structured output template

## Origin Story

These skills were extracted from building an 11-agent personal assistant system with Go backend, React Native frontend, and 205+ test files.

**The numbers:**
- 50+ session observations analyzed (310k+ tokens of development history)
- 15 project-specific skills generalized into 38 universal patterns
- 3 weeks of intensive multi-agent development
- Every skill represents a pattern that emerged from real pain — not a theoretical best practice document
