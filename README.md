# vibe-engineering

A Claude Code plugin with 36 engineering discipline skills. Extracted from real-world multi-agent system development — not theoretical best practices, but patterns that survived 3 weeks of intensive production development.

> "Vibe coding" meets engineering rigor. Every skill here exists because skipping it caused real pain.

## What is this?

A Claude Code plugin with 36 skills that enforce engineering discipline across any project:

- **Research & Decision-Making** (4 skills) — Think before building
- **Quality Gates & Validation** (6 skills) — Catch issues before they ship
- **Learning & Knowledge Management** (5 skills) — Never solve the same problem twice
- **Parallel & Multi-Agent Development** (4 skills) — Scale your work safely
- **Testing Patterns** (5 skills) — Test what matters, not just what's easy
- **Deployment & Operations** (4 skills) — Ship with confidence
- **Gap Analysis & Remediation** (2 skills) — Audit and systematically close gaps
- **Communication & Process** (4 skills) — Stay focused, stay clear
- **Meta Skills** (2 skills) — Skill discovery and routing

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (recommended)

```bash
claude plugin add github:ash1794/vibe-engineering
```

That's it. All 36 skills are now available in every Claude Code session.

### Option 2: Development / local testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ash1794/vibe-engineering.git
claude --plugin-dir ./vibe-engineering
```

### Option 3: Add as a marketplace source

If you want automatic updates when new skills are added:

```bash
# Add as a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add ash1794/vibe-engineering

# Then install
claude plugin install vibe-engineering
```

## Quick Start

After installation, Claude automatically discovers vibe-engineering skills. The bootstrap skill teaches Claude to check for applicable skills before every action.

Explore available skills interactively:
```
/vibe-engineering:vibe-help
```

Invoke any skill directly:
```
/vibe-engineering:vibe-quality-loop
/vibe-engineering:vibe-research-before-design
/vibe-engineering:vibe-reflect-and-compound
```

## Design Principles

1. **Born from pain, not theory** — Every skill exists because skipping it caused real problems
2. **When to use AND when NOT to use** — Every skill has explicit triggers and anti-triggers
3. **Composable** — Skills work independently or together
4. **Non-invasive** — Skills guide, they don't block. WARN, don't FAIL (unless critical)
5. **Cross-project** — No project-specific assumptions. Works with any language/framework

## How It Works

This is a standard Claude Code plugin. The `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest registers it, and the `skills/` directory contains 36 skill definitions that Claude auto-discovers based on task context.

```
vibe-engineering/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin manifest
├── skills/                  # 36 skill definitions
│   ├── vibe-help/SKILL.md
│   ├── quality-loop/SKILL.md
│   ├── research-before-design/SKILL.md
│   ├── gap-analysis/SKILL.md
│   ├── gap-closure-loop/SKILL.md
│   └── ... (31 more)
└── README.md
```

Each skill has:
- **YAML frontmatter** with name, description, and invocation config
- **When to Use** — explicit triggers
- **When NOT to Use** — anti-triggers to prevent misapplication
- **Steps** — the actual workflow
- **Output Format** — structured output template

## Origin Story

These skills were extracted from building [nosaintsville-agent](https://github.com/ash1794/nosaintsville-agent) — an 11-agent personal assistant system with Go backend, React Native frontend, and 205+ test files. Every skill represents a pattern that emerged from real development pain, not a theoretical best practice document.

The extraction process analyzed 50+ session observations (310k+ tokens of development history), 15 project-specific skills, and 3 weeks of intensive development to identify 34 patterns that are genuinely generic and reusable across any project.
